# Snake and Ladder Console Game

Console version of the famous "Snake and Ladder" game developed by Hasham Younas in C++ programming language.

## Important Notes

- Clone the entire repository to ensure you have all the required music files used in the program.
- Use a proper IDE like `Dev-C++` to run the code (VS Code can be used with modifications - see below).
- If using `VS Code`, comment out lines with "PlaySound" or follow a tutorial to enable sound in `Dev-C++`.
- For `Dev-C++`, create a "project," not a "source file." Follow the steps to add `-lwinmm` in project options to enable sound.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-and-ladder.git
cd snake-and-ladder
# Follow instructions to set up your IDE and sound library
# Compile and run the program
