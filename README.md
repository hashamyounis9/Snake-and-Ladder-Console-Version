This game is Console version of famous "Snake and Ladder" game developed by me(Hasham Younas) in C++ programming Language.

Note:
1.    Make sure to Clone the whole repository and not only copy the code as repository is having music files used in the program.
2.    Use a proper IDE like "Dev-C++" to run the code and not text editor i.e "VS Code".
      (You can run it using VS Code but you would have to comment out all the lines having "PlaySound" in them)
3.    You will have to make some changes in Dev-C++ to make it able to run C++ code with "PlaySound" commands as it does not support it by
      default.
      (You can search directly on youtube that how to play sound using C++ in Dev-C++ and follow any tutorail, it would take less tham 5 minutes.)
      (You will have to create a "project" not "source file" in Dev-C++ and goto the tab file->new->project, and select empty project and click ok then save it to preferred location and then goto tab called "project", select "project options" and pop-up will appear, select Prameters tab and then in "Linker" section paste "-lwinmm" and save it.)
      Now you can run this program with background sound in Dev-C++ IDE
